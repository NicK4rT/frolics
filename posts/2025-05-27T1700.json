  "description": "I had a great time exploring this wonderful city, especially its amazing libraries. The most notable being the Parliament Library, for which you need to make an appointment, at which point they let you hop the barrier and walk all the way up and into the Parliament for access. Sadly I couldn't take any pictures, but I did get a library card and included some images from another amazing library I visited. I stayed at the BoHo Budapest and was givena the Heritage Room, which was incredibly beautiful as well.",
