  "description": "I took another long train trip from Trondheim to Gothenburg via Oslo. The beginning was rough, as the train was not able to leave Trondheim due to electricity issues on the line, but eventually we left with a few hours of delay. The journey is once again, breathtaking, and the first class train car is amazing.",
